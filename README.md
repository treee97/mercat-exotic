# Mercat Ex√≤tic
This is a website for a real restaurant on the area where I live.
The concept is to re-design their site and bring a fresh and elegant new look. 

The project was created using Next.js


Cool stuff I found:
- I used [imageEye](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/descargador-de-im%C3%A1genes-i/agionbommeaifngbhincahgmoflcikhm) from the chrome extensions to easily download all the images on their current website
- Also used the [ColorZilla](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/colorzilla/bhlhnicpbhignbdhedgjhgdocnmhomnp) extension, to get the colors.
